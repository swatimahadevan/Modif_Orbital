Target audience: Students of NUS

Motivation: When you are curious to know how difficult a module is, you often find yourself spending a lot of time scouring many online forums trying to find othersâ€™ opinions on it. Imagine how convenient it will be to have one website where you can view modules, submit reviews and rating (out of 5), and even view the reviews and ratings left by other students.

What makes us different?: We provide more succint reviews as well as a forum to make your own threads or leave posts on threads left by others.
